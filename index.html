                    Each one carries a thought to do something big in their life, I had that
                    feeling missing in my life for a very long. But, life had something very unique
                    to offer and it all commenced with a simple article in the newspaper stating
                    that 2 boys from Madhya Pradesh have accomplished their goals to climb
                    Mt. Everest. It gave me a different perspective towards my upcoming life as
                    being an athletic and adventurous human, the article somehow gave wings
                    to my thoughts and excited me in and out completely.
                    I had an agenda clear in my eyes to be the first woman to climb Mt. Everest
                    from the very same state and through this, my dream took a fly and I
                    started to prepare for it completely.

                    the second challenge was limited
                    oxygen cylinder, I had to decide
                    whether I have to go or not, so after
                    thinking I decided to go on 22 May
                    2019 and at 5:00 am of the dawn with
                    the stroke of the light I successfully
                    hosted the Indian flag at the top of Mt

                    The journey which I started had no
                    boundaries, it is ever going and by
                    carrying a lot of enthusiasm and focus
                    towards doing for what I was meant
                    to do, another round of success came
                    up to me when I became the first
                    woman from Madhya Pradesh to
                    climb Mount Elbrus in Russia.

                    It was all the worth of my training and
                    hard work that I put throughout the
                    sessions. It was like traveling near my
                    dreams at a rapid speed. My self esteem was developing and the faith
                    which I had and my father had in was resulting in a positive aspect.

                <p class="wittern-content">
                    With this, I decided to climb all the
                    peaks of the seven continents and
                    make space for my name in history
                    for being the First woman from
                    Madhya Pradesh by making my
                    family and my state proud.

                    My journey to Mt. Everest started with a challenge as my rigorous physical training and
                    the strength-building process were upmost and I was ready to be at heights. We initiated our journey with full positivity but the day we were about to be on the top of
                    Mt. Everest, the weather conditions, as well as our physical limitations, were turning
                    against our will and sadly we had to return just from a distance of 700m to the Everest and
                    every desire was shut down in seconds. All the efforts, training, and beliefs were like
                    breaking down into tiny pieces, and couldn’t imagine seeing my destination in front but
                    couldn’t manage to touch it and feel that very moment.

                <p class="wittern-content">
                    I fought a lot with my depression and constant taunts from people which made me a strong
                    person and cycle again started I started my training again with the same passion and
                    determination but this time during the course of my training session we were rock
                    climbing and one of my teammate lost the grip of the safety rope and I fall from 30ft height
                    straight on my back which resulted in 3 hairline fractures in my spinal cord, doctors
                    suggested to quit my dreams and was recommended bed rest for 8 months, everyone with
                    and around me that it’s over the dream I had no destination now but the believe I had in
                    myself, the stubbornness to reach the Top of the Everest was like a real fire which made
                    me powerful and the goal was clear till the end.

                    The only thing revolving around my head was
                    words of my coach that it’s not difficult to
                    climb Mt Everest, but most difficult is to
                    descend, my Sherpa then asked for help from
                    other Sherpa, and again due to my fortunate
                    luck, I got an oxygen cylinder and made it to
                    the base camp, I asked for the person who
                    gave me his/her cylinder to show my
                    gratitude but I got to know the cylinder
                    belongs to late miss Anjali Kulkarni who died while climbing the mountain, may her soul
                    rest in peace. 
                    <br/>
                    After that, my feelings had no
                    limitations as I was extremely delightful and
                    was feeling pumped up as I finally created
                    history with my name by becoming the first
                    woman from Madhya Pradesh to climb Mt
                    Everest.

                    I come from a nuclear family, my father is a farmer in the same village and
                    my mother is a homemaker. My village only had one government school
                    with a ratio declined towards the boys and only offering till the fifth
                    standard.

                <p class="wittern-content">        
                    My biggest support was my father who held me throughout my journey
                    before and even after my summit.
                    He had my back every single time from my schooling and urge to study
                    more even after declination from the people of the society he stood my me
                    to go for higher studies, he felt the urge that I had beneath myself to study
                    so he came with me crossing all the odds.
                    Further, I did my studies from Acodiya Mandi District Shajapur, and being apart from the family I gained the strength and became independently
                    strong to face every challenge coming towards me.
