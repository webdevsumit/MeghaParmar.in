                <p class="wittern-content">
                    Each one carries a thought to do something big in their life, I had that
                    feeling missing in my life for a very long. But, life had something very unique
                    to offer and it all commenced with a simple article in the newspaper stating
                    that 2 boys from Madhya Pradesh have accomplished their goals to climb
                    Mt. Everest. It gave me a different perspective towards my upcoming life as
                    being an athletic and adventurous human, the article somehow gave wings
                    to my thoughts and excited me in and out completely.
                    I had an agenda clear in my eyes to be the first woman to climb Mt. Everest
                    from the very same state and through this, my dream took a fly and I
                    started to prepare for it completely.
